# Programming Patterns

This chapter is about any non-obvious tricks, programming techniques,
patterns and idioms, that may be useful when programming with Bevy.

These topics are an extension of the topics covered in the [Bevy Programming
Framework][chapter::programming] chapter. See that chapter to learn the
foundational concepts.

Some of the things covered in this chapter might be controversial or only useful
to specific use cases. Don't take this chapter as teaching "general best
practice".

这里介绍的是一些bevy常用的花招/编程技术/泛式/习惯.
这不是适合每个场景的,都是针对特殊场景的一些优解,在其他场景可能就不行了.
