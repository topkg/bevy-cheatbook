Bevy does not fully support all features of the GLTF format and has some
specific requirements about the data. Not all GLTF files can be loaded and
rendered in Bevy. Unfortunately, in many of these cases, you will not get
any error or diagnostic message.

Commonly-encountered limitations:

  - Textures embedded in ascii (`*.gltf`) files (base64 encoding) cannot be loaded.
    Put your textures in external files, or use the binary (`*.glb`) format.
  - Mipmaps are only supported if the texture files (in KTX2 or DDS format) contain them.
    The GLTF spec requires missing mipmap data to be generated by the game engine, but Bevy
    does not support this yet. If your assets are missing mipmaps, textures will look grainy/noisy.

This list is not exhaustive. There may be other unsupported scenarios that I
did not know of or forgot to include here. :)

bevy只支持gltf的部分功能,并不是所有的gltf文件都能加载进bevy.
在部分场景下,还得不到任何错误的诊断信息:
 - gltf文件中,纹理经过了base64编码,这种文件无法加载
 - mip贴图之在ktx2/dds纹理文件中支持

这个列表并不全,还有些错误未包含进来.
